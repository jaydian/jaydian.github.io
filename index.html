 <h2>About us!:<h2>
<center><p id="aboutusparagraph1"> Nothern Mill strives to represent diversity,equity & unity!<br>
     Northern Mill was founded in the year 2000 by Mila Gill. A middle-aged black woman wanting to create a safe space for all of different race, religion, and gender.<br> 
     As a child, Mrs.Gill was bullied for being a black girl and the features that came with it. Through this experience, her motive was to create change within society which starts with building a safe space for the youth.<br>
  We welcome all to express your true identity as well as feel free to explore the possibilities of your future!<br>
    To support this, we offer many programs regarding different career paths for all <br>
