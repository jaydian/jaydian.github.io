<h1>~Department of Psycology~</h1>
  <h2> Welcome to the Department of Psychology! </h2>
  <h3>What is Psycology?</h3>
  <p class="first-department"> Psychology is the scientific study of the mind, brain, and behaviour!<br>
    Psychologists study everything about the human experience from the basic workings of the human brain to consciousness, memory, reasoning and language to personality and mental health.<br>
 The goal of psychology is not only to understand the processes that highlight  human thinking and behaviour, but apply that understanding to solve everyday problems and broader issues.
