<h1>~Department of Psycology~</h1>
  <h2> Welcome to the Department of Psychology! </h2>
  <h3>What is Psycology?</h3>
  <p class="first-department"> Psychology is the scientific study of the mind, brain, and behaviour!<br>
    Psychologists study everything about the human experience from the basic workings of the human brain to consciousness, memory, reasoning and language to personality and mental health.
 The goal of psychology is not only to understand the processes that highlight  human thinking and behaviour, but apply that understanding to solve everyday problems and broader issues.
