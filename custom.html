<h1>~Student life at Nothern Mill~</h1>
  <p> Many schools only talk about the programs provided but we want you to enter our school feeling comfortable with the environment and routine we go by!</p>
<h2>Let's take a further look!</h2>
  <p>From 7:40-8:20 breakfast is provided for all students, first come first serve!<br>
  We acknowledge the importance of students balancing healthy life with education and with that, first comes necessary nutrition!<br>
  We are able to provide this as we are funded by the minister of education, Stephen Lecce.<br></p>
